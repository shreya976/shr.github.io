I am a pre-doctoral fellow at IIM Bangalore in the field of decision science, under the mentorship of [Dr. Saudeep Deb](https://soudeepd.github.io/). Here, I have worked on developing novel methodologies for predicting disease outbreaks, evaluating them using experimental and simulation approaches. Currently, I am focused on quantile autoregression and its efficiency in predicting higher values in time series data. 


I am a dedicated researcher with a post-graduate degree in Statistics and Masterâ€™s in Population Studies. With a profound interest in public health research. With masters in population studies from the International Institute for Population Sciences in Mumbai, my academic journey has been enriched with a comprehensive MSc in Statistics from Sardar Patel University, Anand, Gujarat, and a BSc in Statistics from Savitribai Phule Pune University, Maharashtra.

## Professional Journey

In my recent role as a Statistician and Jr Data Manager at Johns Hopkins India Private Limited, Pune, I played a pivotal role in supervising data management staff, developing clinical risk prediction methods, and contributing to the statistical analysis plans for complex public health and clinical research projects.

## Technical Expertise

Proficient in tools such as **R**, **Python**, **SQL**, and **Tableau**, I thrive in utilizing statistical modeling techniques and inference to derive meaningful insights from large datasets.

## Personal Projects

My commitment to impactful research and analysis is reflected in my personal projects. Notably, a comparative study on maternal healthcare services utilization among tribal women in India stands as a testament to my dedication and passion for making a difference.

## Skills Snapshot

- **Statistical Modeling**: Leveraging advanced statistical techniques to extract valuable insights.
- **Data Management**: Proficient in handling and managing large datasets with tools like SQL.
- **Programming Languages**: Expertise in **R** and **Python** for data analysis and visualization.
- **Machine Learning**: Well-versed in modern machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling.

With a strong foundation in both classical regression techniques and modern machine learning algorithms, I am well-equipped to contribute meaningfully to the dynamic field of statistics and public health research.

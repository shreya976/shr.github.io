I am Shreyas Deshmukh, a passionate researcher with a post-graduate degree in Statistics and a profound interest in public health research. Currently pursuing a Master's in Population Studies at the International Institute for Population Sciences in Mumbai, my academic journey includes a comprehensive MSc in Statistics from Sardar Patel University, Anand, Gujarat, and a BSc in Statistics from Savitribai Phule Pune University, Maharashtra.

In my recent role as a Statistician and Jr Data Manager at Johns Hopkins India Private Limited, Pune, I played a pivotal role in supervising data management staff, developing clinical risk prediction methods, and contributing to the statistical analysis plans for complex public health and clinical research projects. Proficient in tools such as R, Python, SQL, and Tableau, I thrive in utilizing statistical modeling techniques and inference to derive meaningful insights from large datasets. Additionally, my personal projects, including a comparative study on maternal healthcare services utilization among tribal women in India, showcase my commitment to impactful research and analysis. With a strong foundation in both classical regression techniques and modern machine learning algorithms, I am well-equipped to contribute to the dynamic field of statistics and public health research.
